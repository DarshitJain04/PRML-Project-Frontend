## Sentiment Analysis of Drug Reviews (Pill Recommendation System)

> We understood how Data Science and Text Mining have been of significant importance in the health care industry and aim to answer the following questions through our platform: How to use sentiment analysis and predictive modelling to recommend the most effective drugs for the given condition? What is the emotional inclination of users towards a chosen drug? In this project the main aim is to examine the use of sentiment analysis on drug reviews that can aid in identify new opportunities and challenges for any pharmaceutical business. The project aims at classifying the various reviews on the specified drugs based on their polarity with the aid of their rating.
